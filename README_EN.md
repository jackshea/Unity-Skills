## 🚀 Core Features

- ⚡ **Ultimate Efficiency**: Supports **Result Truncation** and **SKILL.md** optimization to maximize token savings.
- 🛠️ **Comprehensive Toolkit**: Built-in 277 Skills with **Batch** operations, significantly reducing HTTP overhead and improving execution efficiency.
- 🛡️ **Safety First**: Supports **Transactional** (atomic operations) with automatic rollback on failure, leaving no residue in scenes.
- 🌍 **Multi-Instance Support**: Automatic port discovery and global registry, enabling simultaneous control of multiple Unity projects.
- 🤖 **Deep Integration**: Exclusive support for **Antigravity Slash Commands**, unlocking the `/unity-skills` interactive experience.
- 🔌 **Full Environment Compatibility**: Perfect support for Claude Code, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, and other mainstream AI terminals.
- 🎥 **Cinemachine 2.x/3.x Dual Version Support**: Auto-detects Unity version and installs the corresponding Cinemachine, supporting **MixingCamera**, **ClearShot**, **TargetGroup**, **Spline**, and other advanced camera controls.

## 🏗️ Supported IDEs / Terminals

This project has been deeply optimized for the following environments to ensure a continuous and stable development experience:

| AI Terminal | Support Status | Special Features |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Antigravity** | ✅ Fully Supported | Supports `/unity-skills` slash commands with native workflow integration. |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Fully Supported | Intelligent Skill intent recognition, supports complex multi-step automation. |
| **Gemini CLI** | ✅ Fully Supported | Experimental support, adapted to the latest `experimental.skills` specification. |
| **Codex** | ✅ Fully Supported | Supports `$skill` explicit invocation and implicit intent recognition. |

## 🏁 Quick Start

### 1. Install Unity Plugin
Add via Unity Package Manager using Git URL:

**Stable Version (main)**:
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity
```

**Beta Version (beta)**:
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity#beta
```

**Specific Version** (e.g., v1.4.0):
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity#v1.4.0
```

> 📦 All version packages are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills/releases) page

### 2. Start Server
In Unity, click menu: `Window > UnitySkills > Start Server`

### 3. One-Click AI Skills Configuration
1. Open `Window > UnitySkills > Skill Installer`.
2. Select the corresponding terminal icon (Claude / Antigravity / Gemini / Codex).
3. Click **"Install"** to complete the environment configuration without manual code copying.

> Installer output files (generated in target directory):
> - `SKILL.md`
> - `scripts/unity_skills.py`
> - Antigravity additionally generates `workflows/unity-skills.md`

> **Codex Note**: **Global installation** is recommended. Project-level installation requires declaration in `AGENTS.md` to be recognized; after global installation, restart Codex to use.

📘 For complete installation and usage instructions, see: [docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md)

### 4. Manual Skills Installation (Optional)
If one-click installation is not supported or preferred, follow this **standard procedure** for manual deployment (applicable to all tools supporting Skills):

#### ✅ Standard Installation Method A
1. **Custom Installation**: In the installation interface, select the "Custom Path" option to install Skills to any directory you specify (e.g., `Assets/MyTools/AI`) for easier project management.

#### ✅ Standard Installation Method B
1. **Locate Skills Source Directory**: The `unity-skills/` directory in this repository is the distributable Skills template (root directory contains `SKILL.md`).
2. **Find the Tool's Skills Root Directory**: Different tools have different paths; refer to the tool's documentation first.
3. **Copy Completely**: Copy the entire `unity-skills/` directory to the tool's Skills root directory.
4. **Directory Structure Requirements**: After copying, maintain the structure as follows (example):
   - `unity-skills/SKILL.md`
   - `unity-skills/skills/`
   - `unity-skills/scripts/`
5. **Restart the Tool**: Let the tool reload the Skills list.
6. **Verify Loading**: Trigger the Skills list/command in the tool (or execute a simple skill call) to confirm availability.

#### 🔎 Common Tool Directory Reference
The following are verified default directories (if the tool has a custom path configured, use that instead):

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`
- Antigravity: `~/.agent/skills/`
- Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/skills/`
- OpenAI Codex: `~/.codex/skills/`

#### 🧩 Other Tools Supporting Skills
If you're using other tools that support Skills, install according to the Skills root directory specified in that tool's documentation. As long as the **standard installation specification** is met (root directory contains `SKILL.md` and maintains `skills/` and `scripts/` structure), it will be correctly recognized.
